# Comquick

Version: 1.0

Comquick (pronounced like comic with a Q or "come-quick", whichever you prefer) is a Publii theme intended for webcomics and related media: webtoons, webmanga, multimedia sequential art, etc. It's a work in progress, and I am not a professional coder, so contributions are welcome.

## How to install

1. [Install and run Publii for Mac, Windows, or Linux.](https://getpublii.com/download/)
1. Name your site.
1. Download this repo as a zip.
1. [Follow the instructions in the Publii docs.](https://getpublii.com/docs/installing-and-updating-publii-themes.html)
1. Have fun!

## Why should I use Comquick for my webcomics and not Wordpress / Tapas / Tumblr / whatever I'm using now?

1. Hosting programs like Wordpress or Tumblr can change without warning, breaking your plugins and themes. You decide if and when Comquick updates, so you can make the best decisions for your site.
1. Relying on webcomic hosting companies means trusting their terms of service, [which don't always have artists' rights in mind](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/controversial-change-tapastaptastic-terms-service-claims-right-first-refusal-webcomics/). Comquick doesn't claim any rights to your work to begin with.
1. Want to switch hosting companies entirely? You can rebuild it in a snap on the new server.
1. Publii produces static websites, which are generally smaller (read: faster and more eco-friendly) than dynamic websites.
1. Pages made with Comquick contain no scripts, trackers, or ads unless you put them there yourself. Unlike major corporations, I don't want your data. (This also increases page load speed.)
1. Publii runs offline on your computer; you only need an internet connection to upload your changes to the web. So if you travel a lot, or internet access is limited in your area, you have more opportunities to work on your projects.
1. It's $0 for life, even if you make money off your work. 100% of your profits are yours to keep.

## Features

If you have any other features you'd like to see, make a feature request in Issues!

## Known Issues and / or Quirks

- The code needs more comments than it has. I'm working on it.
- Accessibility (a11y) optimization: Comquick passes automated a11y tests, but further human testing is needed. If you find an a11y error, please file a bug report explaining what is happening and what should be happening instead.
- Currently, Publii and Comquick are only available in English. Comquick itself can be translated rather easily (a template is included in `/translations`), but Publii doesn't run in other languages. This is out of my hands, though Publii does intend to release multilanguage support in 2021. Translations are welcome; please download the template and read through it beforehand.
- The previous and next buttons behave differently on index pages vs. individual posts, and aren't currently interoperable.
- Many comic sites have a "random" button in the center of the navigation menu. This currently isn't supported; if you know how to implement it, please make a commit!
- Links on the post navigation menu can't be changed without custom HTML. Please get in touch if you have a better solution. (In all fairness, it's not that complicatedâ€”if I can't find a fix, a tutorial should be fine.)
